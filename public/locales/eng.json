    "text": "The main disadvantage of such a surface is its cost: - the cost of the material is significantly higher than other materials used in facade decoration; - the cost of facade cladding with stone and other similar slabs is also quite high; There is also another way of finishing the facade of the building, which combines all the positive aspects of both types of finishes that we have listed. Let's try to analyze them a little bit. The first is a type of mineral–based plaster, which is popularly known as “mineral water“. This liquid solution is made from specially selected rocks, crushed to the desired micron size. After applying such plaster to the surface of the building, the facade acquires a velvety appearance, it will look especially solid and beautiful. This plaster can be washed under pressure. We produce more than 20 types of mineral-based plaster. For more information, see our photo gallery. The peculiarity of this plaster is its sufficient capriciousness during application. And this requires the necessary experience and skills from the master. The cost of this plaster and the cost of its application are slightly higher than the next generation plaster, which we present to your attention. This is a decorative plaster based on travertine. This plaster is easily applied to the surface. Any texture and any pattern can be made from it on the surface. It will not lose its original appearance for a long time. It is very resistant to external influences. Next, we will try to tell you more about it. What is TRAVERTINE? Travertine from the Italian travertino, in Latin lapis tiburtinus — Tibur stone is a polycrystalline brittle fine—grained homogeneous rock formed by calcium carbonate minerals, calcareous deposits of carbon dioxide sources. It is amenable to grinding and polishing. Travertine is used in construction for finishing the exterior and interior surfaces of buildings. Currently, the use of decorative plaster based on travertine is becoming popular, due to its ease of application, excellent appearance, and fairly low cost both when applied and during manufacture. Such decorative plaster consists of almost 90 percent travertine. Decorative plaster based on travertine does not crack after application, it is moisture-resistant, very resistant to low and high weather temperatures. Such plaster can be used for finishing the exterior and interior surfaces of buildings and give them a modern and beautiful look. To increase the service life of this decorative plaster and ensure durability when applied to any surface, our specialists have developed a special application technology. Currently, we produce more than 15 types of these products. The use of natural dyes ensures the durability of each type. Decorative plaster based on travertine is non-toxic, does not emit toxic gases when drying, and is environmentally friendly. What else should we know about travertine-based decorative plaster? Conditions of application, storage and operation of decorative travertine plaster:  application temperature from +5 to +25 C;  sand, stones, lime or other solidified mortar residues are not allowed to enter the solution;  store in the original packaging at a temperature of +5 to +25 C for 6 to 12 months;  after opening the package, the plaster must be used within 24-48 hours;  the solution must not be frozen and stored at a temperature below 0 C before applying, clean the surface from dust, dirt, grease;  the selected surface must be dry and smooth, cracks may appear on an insufficiently dry surface, which will lead to their appearance on the surface of decorative plaster;  prime the base with a special ASMAN putty and let it dry within 24 hours;  mix the plaster thoroughly before applying, diluting with water if necessary, while it is impossible the addition of excessive amounts of water, which can lead to loss of viscosity of the solution;  do not apply in direct sunlight, high humidity, rain;  after application and sufficient drying, a special acrylic varnish should be applied in one or two layers to strengthen and improve the appearance of decorative plaster;  mechanical damage to the finished surface of decorative plaster by a hard object (any hard or sharp object, hail, etc.);  it is not allowed to be applied to a greasy or not completely dried surface;  it is allowed to change the original color of decorative plaster in which pigments were used by 10-15% under the influence of ultraviolet rays of the sun or other weather phenomena;  after a certain period of time, dust or light dirt may settle on the decorative plaster, in such cases it is recommended to rinse the wall surface with water under pressure;  if the product is not fully used, pack the remains into a plastic bag, preventing contact with air.",

When we finish the construction, finishing works require special skills, skills and taste from us. Being not experts in this field, we find it difficult to choose a particular building material. Next, let's focus on some of these materials. The building is built. Plastered. Now there are final finishing works left. What is the best way to finish the facade?
